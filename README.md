example currentDate -> 18 / 10 / 2024

1s

StartDate -> Yesterday 12 AM (i.e. 17/10/2024 12AM) EndDate -> Current time (i.e. 18/10/2024 -> currentTime) Aggregation -> Every second

1m

StartDate -> start of last month (i.e. 1/9/2024 12AM) EndDate -> currentDate - 1 completed day (till 11:59PM) (i.e. 16/10/2024 11:59PM) Aggregation -> Every minute

1h

StartDate -> 1st Jan of last year (i.e. 1/1/2023) EndDate -> 1 completed month earlier (i.e. 31 / 8 / 2024) Aggregation -> hourly data

Removed -> | This month | minute | 1m | | Last 30 days | minute | 1m | | This week | minute | 1m |

| TimeRange | Aggregation | Id | | Last year | hourly | 1h | | Current year | hourly | 1h | | Current year -> Q1,2,3,4 | hourly | 1h | | Last 6 months | hourly | 1h | | Last month | minute | 1m | | Last week | minute | 1m | | Yesterday | second | 1s | | Today | second | 1s | | Last 12hr | second | 1s | | Last 24hr | second | 1s |

Challenge -> where to store data?

-> Each code run will fetch data for 1s, 1m, 1h historical data -> These historical data would be stored in local variables

Challenge -> How will you get updated data everyday?

-> Restart your server everyday in downtime -> (10min) (Is it okay with clients?)

Pros: -> Use-case is solved

Cons: -> Initial load time would be steap -> Memory usage could be higher

What is the deployment procedure?

Not in place
